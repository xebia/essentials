Automate the entire release and deployment process

---

The release and deployment process should be fast, reliable and repeatable several times a day.

---

### Motivation

Software release and deployment processes are often riddled with manual steps and hand offs. This makes the release process slow, error prone and expensive.

### Applicability

Whenever there are manual processing steps or hand-offs involved in your release and deployment process, you should automate it.


### Application

* automate the build process with CI servers like Jenkins or Bamboo
* automate the deployment process with Application Release Automation products like Deployit
* automate the acceptance testing with products like Jbehave and Cucumber
* automate the system integration tests with Fitnesse and Selenium
* automate the installation and configuration of machines and middleware with products like Puppet and Chef.

### Consequences

Once your software delivery process is automated, you will be able to deploy new versions of your application faster, more frequently with less errors and man power.
