Improve practices, don't just follow the recipe

---

With all &lsquo;best practices&rsquo;, principles and experience, you should
always keep an eye on the context: does what used to work there and then also
work here and now? Keep thinking, keep looking.

---

All "Best Practices", principles and experience are rooted in a certain context. What worked then and there may not work here and now. You can take pretty much any accepted best practice, change the context around it, and turn it into the worst thing you could have possibly done. Don't make a choice by default, don't do what you always did. Don't follow advice, no matter how well intentioned, without thinking about the consequences. [Don't walk off a cliff](dare-to-say-no) because someone in a position of authority told you to. Pick an appropriate solution for the problem at hand. Pick a [better solution](improve-continuously) than the one you used last time.

The appropriate solution may of course be a common Best Practice. They're called that for a reason. Just think when you apply one.
