Done = Live!

---

The work of the development team is only done, when the feature is live in production.

---

### Motivation

Whenever there is a strong separation between development, QA and operations, developers are often unaware of the problems and issues that are encountered when the software is put in production. In these situation, the developer assumes that the work is done after the checked changes are checked in into the version management system and marked as resolved in the issue tracking system. But until the change is in production, it is unsure whether the work is really finished.

### Applicability

This principle is applicable for any organisation where creating software is strictly separated from maintaining, running and operating the software. Note that this is generally a poor way of structuring a development organisation. It's more effective if the original developers of a piece of code [are also its stewards](build-it-run-it).

### Application

Create multi-disciplinary teams and make sure that the team's work is defined as done, only when the change has been put into production and is in working to satisfactorily.
