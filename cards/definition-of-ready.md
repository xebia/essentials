Work on stories when they're ready

---

Have a Definition of READY to judge whether a user story is fit to go into a sprint.

* Do the team members understand the story?
* Is the story sized correctly?
* Have the acceptance criteria been defined?
* Are the external dependencies in place?
* How will the demo look?

---

### Motivation

Definition of Ready aims to define an acceptance criteria that a User Story must pass in order to become eligible to be considered for inclusion in Ready sprint backlog.

### Applicability

Definition of Ready is an important tool that can be used by a scrum team to judge whether a user story is ready to be taken up for discussion in a sprint planning.

### Application

While planning a sprint, a User Story must pass the following criteria in order to become eligible for inclusion in a sprint.

* A User Story must define an acceptance criteria which is testable.
* A User Story must also share information on why is it required, giving the team a bigger context on the importance of the story.
* Team should be able to estimate it; In other words there should be a loose implementation strategy associated with it.

### Consequences

By including a story in the sprint that is not READY, the team risks building something that is not fully defined; This may lead to re-work. Another consequence could be expanding/shrinking scope of the problem of the story while the sprint is in progress.
