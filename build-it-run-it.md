You build it, you run it!

### Motivation

Often development teams are totally unaware on how their software behaves in production and what the effect is on the end users. All problems are experienced by the operations department and any complaints are handled by first and second line support. The pain of low quality software is not felt by the developers.

### Application

Create autonomous systems and build multidisciplinary teams around them that are responsible for the system in production.

### Consequences

### References

The principle "you build it, you run it". was used by Werner Vogels to explain the organisation of the development teams at Amazon.
