### Motivation

Poor or poorly understood communication is a common cause for failures, ineffective teams and interpersonal tension.

### Applicability

Any job or environment where more than one person is involved. There even is strong evidence that a single person benefits from communicating with a fictitious partner (such as a rubber duck or a cardboard cutout of your favorite celebrity), a technique known as Rubber Ducking.

### Application

Not all methods of communication are created equal. Choose the best available means of communication.
