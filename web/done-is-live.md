### Motivation

Whenever there is a strong separation between development, QA and operations, developers are often unaware of the problems and issues that are encountered when the software is put in production. In these situation, the developer assumes that his work is done after he checked his changes in into the version management system and marked the problem as resolved in the issue tracking system. But until the change is in production, it is unsure whether his work is really finished.

### Applicability

This principle is applicable for any organisation where creating software is strictly separated from maintaining, running and operating the software.

### Application

Create multi-disciplinary teams and make sure that the team's work is defined as done, only when the change has been put into production and is in working to satisfactorily.
