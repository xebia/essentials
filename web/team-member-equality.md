### Also known as

One team.

### Motivation

We distinguish on the validity of the ideas, not on roles, authority or location.

Every member of a team has special skills that add to the success of the project or product. Werther it be the analytical skills of the business analyst, the out of the box way of thinking of the tester or the tool knowledge of the programmer.
