### Motivation

Your brain does not handle multitasking as well as you think. Enhance your productivity by focusing completely on one task at a time.

### Application

Resisting distractions requires some discipline. There are many things you can do to make it easier:

Auto-hide your taskbar or dock.
Close (or at least mute) your email and IM clients.
Establish "no distraction" times in your team.
If you tend to procrastinate, consider a service like RescueTime.
If you are easily distracted by sounds, consider headphones. Some people listen to brown noise instead of music to block out distractions.
Consequences

By focusing your attention on a single task at a time, you'll get more work done over a course of time, with better results on every task.
