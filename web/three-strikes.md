* The first time you do something, just do it by hand.
* The second time you do something similar, wince at the repetition and do it anyway.
* The third time you do something similar, you automate.

### Motivation

We're not in the software business to perform repetitive work. If we can automate business processes we can just as well automate the dull work in our daily job.
