<p>Dare to say no</p>

<p>In Software Engineering, some things are just not
      possible. Stand up for your values as a professional and refuse
      to do them! A good doctor will not promise to heal everything
      either.

### Also known as

First, do no harm.

### Motivation

In software engineering, not everything is possible.

### Applicability

As a software engineer, you are a skilled professional with knowledge, experience and expertise in software development. As such, you can judge when something might be possible ("if we work flat-out we might just be able to hack it together in time...") but would simply be bad ("...but it sure will be one unmaintainable, ugly beast of a piece of code."). Don't allow your software to cause you sleepless nights.

### Application

Don't let yourself be pressured into committing to delivering features that simply cannot be delivered to the standard of quality you, as a professional, regard as necessary. If the Product or business owner says that there "must be a way", that there must be some [corners](clean-build) [you](dry-principle) [can](code-review) [cut](boy-scout-rule) or [tests you can skip](test-everything), ask them if they would trust a surgeon who would happily skip the disinfection in order to save 10 minutes.

### Consequences

Software engineers pride themselves on solving problems and "doing the impossible". This can lead to the expectation that there is always a way. Prepare to push back in such environments, and remember that as a professional yours is an expert opinion that cannot simply be ignored by a business owner without serious consequences for you both.
