	<h1>Software Development Done Right</h1>
	<p>Good software does not come about just like that; by mere
		coincidence. Inside a streamlined and well-executed software
		development process, there are many patterns for success. Some of them
		extend well beyond what is traditionally considered to be the realm of
		the software developer.</p>

	<p>Inside our organization, many of these patterns were applied
		either consciously or subconsciously. We felt the need to bring these
		patterns forward from under lock and key into the clear light of day
		for everyone's awareness.</p>

	<p>After months of gathering, slicing, dicing and eventual
		distilling, we arrived at what we consider to be the 'Essentials',
		distributed as a pack of flash cards. In many cases it involves ideas,
		or the expression of those ideas, for which we cannot take credit
		ourselves. In those cases, we have strived to grant credit to the
		originators, being fully aware that greatness can only be achieved by
		standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>

	<p>We are not going to explain how you should put this deck to good
		use. As Einstein said, “imagination is more important than knowledge”,
		and thus we encourage you to rely on your imagination. At the very
		least, these cards are a promise for a conversation. And these
		conversations are a breeding ground for new ideas.</p>

	<p>We are convinced, it's many of these ideas that make our people
		into the craftsmen they are. Take a look at the full list of cards and
		see for yourself.</p>
